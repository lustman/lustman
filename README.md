Hi, I am Vladimir✌️\
My journey started at CS:GO's legacy HvH time, when I was inspired by 0x000cb.\
The sexy stuff I love is malware analysis and deobfuscation. Despite the complexity, it's very engaging, and the result pays off😁

I am looking forward to collaboration and skills exchange.\
You can reach me via Signal: `beta.07`
